A 2D exploration game built in **Godot (GDScript)** where you pilot a robot rover across procedurally generated alien worlds. Your mission: drop onto unknown planets, scan exotic flora and fauna, and survive the hostile environment to fill your scientific journal.

##  Gameplay Loop

1.  **Drop:** Land on a unique, procedurally generated planet.
2.  **Explore:** Navigate your rover across diverse terrains and biomes.
3.  **Scan:** Identify and catalog random plant and animal life forms.
4.  **Survive:** Avoid environmental hazards and hostile wildlife to protect your data.
5.  **Upgrade:** Improve your rover's tools and capabilities to explore more dangerous worlds.

## Features

### Current Features (Prototype)
* **Procedural Terrain:** Basic randomized tilemap generation creating unique landscapes every run.
* **Rover Controller:** Functional player movement with physics and trail rendering.

###  Roadmap & Planned Features
- [ ] **Ecosystem Randomization:** Unique plants and animals generated per world seed (appearance and stats).
- [ ] **AI Behaviors:** distinct behaviors for wildlife (passive, aggressive, fleeing).
- [ ] **Biomes:** Distinct environmental zones (e.g., desert, tundra, forest) with specific tile sets.
- [ ] **Dynamic Environment:** Animated land and ocean tiles to bring the world to life.
- [ ] **Progression:** Rover upgrades (speed, scanner range, defense) and a persistent Journal/Compendium.
